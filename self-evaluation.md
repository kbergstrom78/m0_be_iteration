# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    This method would be very helpful, particularly in arrays that have many elements to them.  It allows for applying actions to elements in bulk rather than having to individually code for each element.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    This was refreshingly intuitive for me.  Looking forward to digging in a bit more.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    I love being able to test run the code and knowing what did or did not work
